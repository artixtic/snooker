# Production Environment Configuration for Electron
# Copy this file to .env.production and update with your production values
# NEVER commit .env.production to version control

# and connects to the backend server. These settings are for reference.

# Backend API URL (if running Electron with remote backend)
# In production, Electron typically uses the bundled backend
API_URL="http://localhost:4001"

# Frontend URL (for development mode only)
# In production, Electron loads from file://
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:4000"
